<p>OSI model - <em>open system interconnection model</em> is a critical building block for your
understanding of networking. It helps you troubleshoot networks, if the cable isn&rsquo;t plugged (Physical - layer 1).
<br/>
<br/></p>

<h4 id="layers">Layers</h4>

<p>It consist of layers shown in the figure beneath this text, and the layers are read
bottom up.
Application, presentation and session layer is the primary focus of developers / SysAdmin / ServerAdmin.</p>

<p>Easy way to memorize the layers is to remember the sentence &ldquo;All people sleeping through networking don&rsquo;t pass&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>There are multiple advantages to the OSI model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard(ISO) and interoperability (the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information).</li>
<li>Split development (developer working in layer 7, does not need to know what is happening in layer 2).</li>
</ul>

<p><br/></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="layer-7-application-layer">Layer 7 - Application layer</h3>

<p>This layer is very familiar for you, where applications such as HTTP, FTP and TELNET are used at this layer. You have to note that the application layer is not about individual applications (Chrome/Firefox), it is about the application protocol (HTTP that web browsers use). <strong>The layer is the for users and application process to access network recourses and services.</strong></p>

<h4 id="so-what-do-the-application-layer-do">So what do the application layer do?</h4>

<ul>
<li>This layer provides network processes to application.</li>
<li>It provides access for users and application processes to utilize network services.</li>
<li>This layer provides the network services to the application (web browsers)</li>
<li>It can identify communication partners</li>
<li>Provide user authentication</li>
</ul>

<p>So what does that mean? The simplest way to explain this is:
Picture Microsoft Word, it works with many different protocols, and then use the protocols to communicate with the lower layers of the OSI model.</p>

<p>Other examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote file access</li>
<li>Remote printer access</li>
<li>Resource sharing</li>
<li>Directory services</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layer-6-presentation-layer">Layer 6 - Presentation layer</h3>

<p>This layer is concerned with the actual format the data is presented in i.e., we are looking at data representation / syntax. Presentation layer has to ensure that data is <strong>readable</strong> by receiving system. Data that is sent from one application can be successfully read by another application.</p>

<p>You might think that different system format their data different, and you are right. The data needs to be changed to <strong>machine independent format</strong> (ASCII, MP3, JPG). <strong>So this layer formats data to be presented to application layer.</strong></p>

<p>The layer also structures the data, negotiates data transfer syntax (using ASCII or unicode). It can also <strong>provide encryption</strong>: if you are sending music file from a device to another one, this layer will assure that the data is transmitted in the format that both sides understand.</p>

<h3 id="layer-5-session-layer">Layer 5 - Session layer</h3>

<p>The session layer is concerned with interhost communication. This layer is involved in the maintenance, establishment and termination of sessions between applications. This allows two application processes on different machines, to establish a session between them. This acts like a coordinator of communication between systems. So various protocols at this layer ensure that request and responses between applications can work properly over a session, but between those end-user application processes.</p>

<p>Indicates session layer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Name recognition</li>
<li>Logging</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layer-4-transport-layer">Layer 4 - Transport layer</h3>

<p>This layer ensures <strong>end to end communication</strong>, reliability and flow control. It also performs <strong>message segmentation</strong>, it accepts a message from the session layer, splits the message into smaller units and pass it down to the network layer for sending. <strong>Session multiplexing</strong> takes place at this layer, this allows for multiplexing several message streams or sessions into one logical link, this layer will keep track of which message belongs to which session. <strong>Flow control</strong> might be implemented in this layer, it will manage data transmission between devices to ensure that the transmitting device does not send more data than the receiving device can process.
<br/></p>

<p>Other things that transport layer does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensures data transport <strong>reliability</strong></li>
<li>Handles transportation issues between host</li>
</ul>

<p>Two main protocols at this layer is <strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission control protocol) and <strong>UDP</strong> (User Datagram Protocol), <em>please check the TCP/UDP post for more information.</em></p>

<p><strong>TCP</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provides reliability</li>
<li>Establishes, maintains and terminates virtual circuits between devices.</li>
<li>So end systems will go through what&rsquo;s called the <strong>TCP handshake</strong> to establish a connection between each other</li>
<li>If the packets is missing it will be retransmitted</li>
<li>Acknowledgement of receipt of information</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UDP</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does not provide reliability</li>
<li>If packets are dropped, they are lost</li>
<li>Does not retransmit lost packets<br /></li>
<li>&ldquo;Lightweight&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layer-3-network-layer">Layer 3 - Network layer</h3>

<p>This layer is all about data delivery, where routers route data packets from one device to another. Cisco have something called layer 3 switches, they have router capabilities so that they can also route packet between VLANS within a network as an example. They chose the best path to deliver data based on the information provided. Here we have routing protocols like <strong>OSPF</strong> (Open shortest path first), <strong>BGP</strong> (border gateway protocol) or <strong>IS-IS</strong> (intermediate system-to-intermediate system). They use the logical addressing scheme of IPv4 to determine the best path.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria to determine the best path</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Hop count</li>
<li>Bandwith</li>
<li>Longest match of network address</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, this layer provides path determination and logical addressing.</p>

<h3 id="layer-2-data-link-layer">Layer 2 - Data link layer</h3>

<p>Here it provides physical addressing and access to media, it is concerned how data is formatted from upper layers for transmission over a given network technology. It is also concerned with how access to the network is controlled.
<br/>
<strong>The data link layer ensures that the data from higher layers is formatted correctly for transmission across individual physical links, where the physical links characteristics may vary (one link may be ethernet, PPP across a serial cable and other link may use DSL)</strong></p>

<h3 id="layer-1-physical-layer">Layer 1 - Physical layer</h3>

<p>The first layer in the OSI model is the physical layer, it defines here how data is transmitted <strong>So in other words, what state represents a 0 or a 1</strong>. It defines the electrical, mechanical, procedural and functional specifications for activating, maintaining and deactivating the physical link. This allows for <strong>interoperability</strong>. So long story short, it is about how to code/decode series of bits from and to the physical device (cable etc..).</p>
