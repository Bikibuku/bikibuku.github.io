      <description>Compression using the LZW algorithm The algorithm was created ~1984 and is a simple algorithm to implement. In these type of exercises they provide us information that we start with 256 index and up, and we have to write the output. Lets use &amp;ldquo;SASS_SASSER_SAM_SAMRE&amp;rdquo; as an example.
I recommend to write input, dictionary and output in a table.
The meaning of this algorithm is to re-use words in the dictionary so the output gets compressed, it is explained what is happening in the comment section.</description>

      <title>Hashing</title>

      <description>Some basic information about hashing I would like to remind you that there are many different types of hashing, the one I am using is used in my course. The code is from Algorithms in C++ by Robert Segdewick.
In this type of hashing you will find array, keys and return value.  The integer M is the length of the array, in this case it is 17 (0-16). You got two different hash types, where k is the letter number (A = 1).</description>

      <title>Subnetting</title>

      <description>Important things to know before learning Subnetting is a bit complicated, here we will learn how to find the subnet address, 1st host address, last host adress and the broadcast address by knowing the IP address. There are some methods which is quicker, but I feel once you mastered some binary tasks, you will be able to do this quicker. I feel this is a lot more safer and more efficient way to do it.</description>

      <description>I made this section since I am currently taking the Computer Networking course, and I feel the best way to learn is to explain and educate others. This is my first time trying, and it is still under development.
Feel free to roam and learn, any feedback would be nice as well.

      <description>OSI model - open system interconnection model is a critical building block for your understanding of networking. It helps you troubleshoot networks, if the cable isn&amp;rsquo;t plugged (Physical - layer 1).  
Layers It consist of layers shown in the figure beneath this text, and the layers are read bottom up. Application, presentation and session layer is the primary focus of developers / SysAdmin / ServerAdmin.
   Layers Number      Application 7 All   Presentation 6 People   Session 5 Sleeping   Transport 4 Through   Network 3 Networking   Datalink 2 Don&amp;rsquo;t   Physical 1 Pass     Easy way to memorize the layers is to remember the sentence &amp;ldquo;All people sleeping through networking don&amp;rsquo;t pass&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Who am I? My name is Abu Baker Al-Shammari, I live in Norway and I am currently studying IT-Operation and Information security. The reason why I chose to study it is simply because of my interest for security and privacy. What I like to do beside studying is training, it makes it easier to cool off. In my second year of university I became interested in CTF&amp;rsquo;s, it is a good way to learn variety of tools and methods.</description>
