      <description>Who am I? My name is Abu Baker Al-Shammari, I live in Norway and I am currently studying IT-Operation and Information security. The reason why I chose to study it is simply because of my interest for security and privacy. What I like to do beside studying is training, it makes it easier to cool off. In my second year of university I became interested in CTF&amp;rsquo;s, it is a good way to learn variety of tools and methods.</description>
