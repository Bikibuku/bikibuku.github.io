<h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h3>

<p>My name is <strong>Abu Baker Al-Shammari</strong>, I live in Norway and I am currently studying IT-Operation and Information security. The reason why I chose to study it is simply because of my interest for security and privacy. What I like to do beside studying is training, it makes it easier to <em>cool off</em>. In my second year of university I became interested in CTF&rsquo;s, it is a good way to learn variety of tools and methods. Since then, I have been watching some reverse engineering videos, maybe some of my work will be posted here.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-this-website-for">What is this website for?</h3>

<p>There are many reasons for this website, one of them is to document what I&rsquo;ve been working on meanwhile studying. I also feel that if you are capable of teaching your work or subjects to people, it will kind of justify your knowledge more than your grade. If you have something that you want me to check or something that is written poorly, do not be afraid to contact me. I also want to thank my colleague for helping me with this website, pay him a <a href="http://easiersaidthand.one/post/simpleblog/">visit</a> if you are curious.</p>
